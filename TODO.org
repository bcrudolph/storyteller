*** Prize items/level up faster for completing game challenges/achievements
** Sympathy (Name of the Wind)
*** Energy sources (sacrifice HP) increase spell power
*** Knowledge of opponent increases effeciveness
** Before battle formations
*** Hints as to the next enemy before encountering them
*** Lots of small enemies should be fought by a centralized unit (watch each others back)
*** Few big enemies should be fought while spread out (tank draws attention)
*** Spells can be more effective on focused groups - e.g. group heal works better when clustered.
