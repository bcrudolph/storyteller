Ideas/Mechanics
---------------
Sympathy (Name of the Wind)
 - Energy sources (sacrifice HP) increase spell power
 - Knowledge of opponent increases effectiveness
Combat Challenges
 - Prize items/level up faster for completing challenges
Before battle formations
 - Lots of small enemies should be fought by a centralized unit (watch each others back)
 - Few big enemies should be fought while spread out.
 - Spells can be more effective on more focused groups - group heal works better when clustered.
